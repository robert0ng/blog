This job was worked with a team of 3 people. It's outsourced by a small company originated from Netherland.

My job was to implement an Android app to resemble exactly its iOS app. Most interesting feature is scrolling across holes to enter score. Due to lack of any knowledge of calculating the score, it's quite a long way to understand the formula along the way ;p

The app has 3 main tabs and navigation trail at left.
